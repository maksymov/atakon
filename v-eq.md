Vacuum furnaces are designed for heating in a vacuum and in a protective gas environment, hardening in a gas and oil environment of parts made of titanium nickel and other heat-resistant alloys.

They meet all "NADCAP" requirements and AMS 2750D and RPS 953 standards. 

**The main characteristics of furnaces:**

- Operating temperature 500 - 2200°C.
- Uniformity of temperature in the working zone of the furnace is not more than ± 5°C.
- Maximum vacuum in the working area up to 10-6mbar.
- Maximum working gas pressure during quenching up to 20 bar.
- Molybdenum, tungsten or graphite ring heating elements.
- Water cooling of the furnace body and door, current leads and cooling gas circulation pipes. External gas hardening system with powerful fan and water heat exchanger.
- Autoclave oven door with pneumatic lock.
- Sealed connector for connecting up to 12 thermocouples in the oven.
- Large set of additional accessories at the discretion of the customer.
- Light and sound signaling of violations in the operation of furnace systems with display.
- Long-term operation with minimal maintenance. Free access to all furnace systems.
- Computer control and automatic operation.

**Vacuum furnaces are equipped with:**

- Molybdenum "shelves" for placing parts in the furnace.
- Loading "tables" for laying (unloading) parts on (with) "shelf(s).
- A transport trolley for loading (unloading) the "shelf" with parts into the oven (from the oven).
