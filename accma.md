The catalog of our company includes equipment from the German manufacturer NCS Germany. This relatively young company was founded in 2013. But its products have already received excellent reviews and recognition due to their high accuracy, thoughtfulness, and wide service options. An analyzer for the content of certain chemical elements (C, S, N, O and H) in metals can be seen in laboratories and industrial enterprises, in a metallurgical shop and in a glass industry.

How analyzers from NCS Germany work
The devices of this company are divided into two groups:

Analyzer of oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen content in metals. The sample loaded into a graphite crucible is burned in a pulse furnace. The device analyzes the gas formed after the combustion of the sample. The data received from the detectors are transmitted to a PC, where the concentrations of oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen are calculated.
Analyzer of carbon and sulfur content in metals. In the induction furnace, the sample loaded into the ceramic crucible is burned. The process takes place in an environment of pure oxygen using a catalyst. The purified gas is fed to infrared detectors, which determine the concentration of CO2 and SO2. The content of carbon and sulfur is calculated using specialized software.
