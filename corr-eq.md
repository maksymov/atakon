 The autoclave is a test cell with the possibility of creating a test medium with high pressure and temperature. The autoclave can be used both separately (static) and together with a recirculation circuit (dynamic). Autoclaves, like recirculation circuits, can be made from a variety of materials. The most common material for manufacturing is stainless steel. More corrosion resistant materials such as Hastelloy (Alloy C 276) and Titanium are used where necessary. For low temperature testing, Teflon coating can be used in autoclaves.

The autoclave, as a rule, has a cylindrical shape, but can be made in any other form, depending on the requirements of the customer. A flow cell is a tube through which water flows. Electrochemical and corrosion sensors can be installed both in the lid and in the bottom of the autoclave.

Low pressure test cells offer a wide range of design options as they do not assume pressure. Hydrogen Cracking Cells (HIC Method) are typically large glass containers that are tested in accordance with NACE TM 0284-11 and TM0177-05 Method B.

Autoclaves can include many add-ons and accessories such as electrochemical instruments, electromechanical and servo-hydraulic testers, mixers, agitators and rotating electrodes.

Cormet also manufactures a variety of TLC (thin layer) instruments with constant purge and cooled finger samples. Optionally, the set includes a small funnel under the sample, where drops of water condense. This water can be taken from the autoclave for chemical or electrochemical analysis can be carried out online in the funnel itself.

Hydrogen penetration tests are carried out in accordance with ISO 17081:2004(E) using a two-cell autoclave with a steel plate in between. Corrosion reaction and hydrogen evolution starts in one of the cells. Next, hydrogen penetrates through a steel plate into another autoclave, where its content is measured using an electrochemical method. Cormet designed this system for high-pressure and high-temperature applications, in conjunction with a loading device that provides a load on a steel plate. This system makes it possible to study the effect of pressure, temperature, and voltage on the kinetics of hydrogen penetration.
