In the development of ELP, two technologies are combined into one whole: obtaining a high-quality raster image in secondary and reflected electrons (SEM) and a balanced three-electrode scheme of electron beam welding, which is common to both devices and consists of a cathode-anode block and a control electrode. The crossover calculation was carried out and optimized taking into account the features of beam formation for both optoelectronic systems.

Due to the properly balanced configuration of these elements and the focusing system, it is possible to achieve a beam diameter at the welding point of 15 Âµm.

For stable operation of the gun, it uses differential dry pumping by a separate turbomolecular pump and a vacuum control sensor in the cathode-anode block. ELP is equipped with electromagnetic raster centering, stigmatizing and focusing systems, a reflected electron detector with coaxial placement.

A secondary electron detector with a tilt angle of 45 degrees is installed in the chamber, as well as a coaxial video surveillance system for the workpiece in the same direction as the electron beam, which ensures observation of the welding process at low welding currents.

The ELP provides for operation with two types of cathodes: V-shaped (tungsten) or LaB6 (lanthanum hexaboride). The design of the gun allows you to quickly change the cathode units within 2-3 minutes due to the preliminary alignment of the cathode in the block using special technological devices.
