An innovative development for the production of components from several materials printed on a 3D printer.

The latest breakthrough, CeraFab Multi 2M30, brings the idea of ​​3D printing complex geometries from multiple materials. With this 3D printer, it is possible to combine not only ceramics, but also metals and polymers, which contributes to the gradual change in the composition and organization of materials within a component. The open system allows you to develop your own materials, and now you can produce multifunctional components that are not possible with conventional molding technologies. Designers can integrate additional processes (eg inkjet printing, coating) to extend the CeraFab Multi 2M30's range of capabilities for even more complex applications.
