 The new Sirio on-site hydrogen generator, by virtue of the very high levels of purity guaranteed by ErreDue’s PEM (proton exchange membrane) technology, perfectly meets the needs of all those applications where a moderate amount of pure, compressed gas is needed, such as heat treatment of metals and Biomethane production processes.

Sirio is Plug & Play: thanks to its ease of use and autonomy, it only needs to be connected to an electrical power source and the tank filled with water to be able to produce pure hydrogen immediately at the pressio- n and flow rate required. In fact, it does not require any auxiliary systems: the unit includes a generator, water tank and purification system for the gas produced.

Hydrogen flow rate starts from 0.5 m3/h up to 2 m3/h, it is also possible to connect multiple systems in paral- lelo. The maximum pressure generated reaches up to 15 bar in catalog models and can be customized up to 30 bar on request.

ErreDue Sirio hydrogen generators can be monitored and managed remotely with ErreDue’s built-in connectivity and remote service.
